<p>The 2020 Maserati Ghibli is a midsize luxury sedan that aims to charm with style and a bit of Italian flair. You'd expect as much from Maserati, and indeed the Ghibli is a more distinctive choice compared to the typical luxury sedans from America, Europe and Japan. Like many Italians, it's a car that appeals first and foremost to your heart, and it's easy to see why when the Ferrari-derived 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 sings such a sweet song.</p>
<p>Changes for 2020 are minor, with more standard and optional equipment for most models. Most notably, the GranSport and GranLusso trims now come standard with a driver assistance package that includes features such as adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning. The base model gets soft-close doors and a heated leather steering wheel, too.</p>
